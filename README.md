## Random Map Generator

This project provides a Random Map Generator, which generates a random map. In the map, you can surely find the path between any two points.

Moreover, this project also shows you the performance of several algorithms:

- Breadth First Search

- Depth First Search

- Iterative Deepening Search

- Bidirectional Breadth First Search

- Bidirectional Depth First Search

- Bidirectional Iterative Deepening Search

- Uniform Cost Search

- Greedy Best First Search

- A Star Search

- Bidirectional A Star Search

- Iterative Deepening A Star Search
